**Vulnerability:** The `safeMarked` utility in `packages/web/lib/safeMarked.ts` did not filter image protocols and failed to properly escape attributes like `href` on links.
**Learning:** This oversight allows an attacker to inject XSS payloads using specially crafted URLs for links/images (e.g., `![x](javascript:alert(1))` or `[x](https://x.com"onmouseover="alert(1)")`) even when raw HTML is stripped.
**Prevention:** Always implement a full custom renderer that not only filters dangerous protocols but comprehensively escapes HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `"`) from user-provided URLs and titles.
